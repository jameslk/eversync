EverSync
Author: James Koshigoe

Description:
   This simple script continuously syncs (one-way) a local directory's contents with another directory or remote
   resource by using rsync. It uses the em-dir-watcher gem to be notified upon changes. For each file changed,
   it executes rsync on the path to sync that specific file only, instead of running rsync over the entire directory
   structure.
